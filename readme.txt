Ludum Dare Project Template

By mkv25.net games - for Haxe + OpenFL projects using Flash Develop.

Background:

I'm approaching my 6th Ludum Dare, and I've settled on a few things with my tools that are common between releases, such as how I package files up to put them on a website, where I put stuff that I'm workin on, how I manage screenshots and blog posts, and so on. To make it easy to get all this ready for a new Ludum Dare event I've stripped back one of my projects and built a 1 screen demo that includes all my basic libraries, a few graphics, some text, some buttons, and some sounds.

The project builds in Flash Develop using OpenFL (if you have it installed) and provides a nice base to work from.

Folder structure:

audio/ - audio assets to big to be considered code
code/ - all source code, build instructions, final image assets, and final audio
design/ - design ideas and inspiration
photos/ - screenshots and photos of the project for distribution on social media
release/ - packaged releases get stored here
website/ - source code for the website lives here with binaries for the game
